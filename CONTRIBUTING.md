### Contributing Options

You can contribute in the following ways:

#### **PATH A**: Complete Existing Tasks

Contribute by completing tasks listed in the `README.md` file of the respective course folder. Ensure your solutions align with the course’s structure and guidelines.

#### **PATH B**: Add a New Task

If you wish to add a new task to an existing course:

1. Check the `README.md` file of the respective course for its current structure.
2. Add a new task only if the course has fewer than 10 tasks.
3. Ensure the task is relevant, educational, and practical for learners.

### Advanced Path

Want to add a completely new course? Follow these steps:

1. Check for unchecked courses in the **Available Courses** section of the repository’s `README.md`.
2. Create a new folder in the root directory with the course name.
3. Inside the folder, create a `README.md` file and include:
   - A course description.
   - Up to 10 tasks for learners.

> **Important:** You must complete at least one basic path before taking the advanced path. The review process for new courses takes more time, and changes may be rejected if they do not meet the project’s standards.
